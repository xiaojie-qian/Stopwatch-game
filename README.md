# Stopwatch game
It is a mini-game using Python and its package of simplegui. The rules are as below

- The program successfully opens a frame with the stopwatch stopped.

- The program has a working "Start" button that starts the timer.

- The program has a working "Stop" button that stops the timer.

- The program has a working "Reset" button that stops the timer (if running) and resets the timer to 0.

- The time is formatted according to the description in step 4 above. Award partial credit corresponding to 1 pt per correct digit. For example, a version that just draw tenths of seconds as a whole number should receive 1 pt. A version that draws the time with a correctly placed decimal point (but no leading zeros) only should receive 2 pts. A version that draws minutes, seconds and tenths of seconds but fails to always allocate two digits to seconds should receive 3 pts.

- The program correctly draws the number of successful stops at a whole second versus the total number of stops. Give one point for each number displayed. If the score is correctly reported as a percentage instead, give only one point.

- The "Stop" button correctly updates these success/attempts numbers. Give only one point if hitting the "Stop" button changes these numbers when the timer is already stopped.

- The "Reset" button clears the success/attempts numbers.
